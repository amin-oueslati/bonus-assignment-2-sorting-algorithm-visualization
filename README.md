@authors: Oskar Krafft | Paul Sharratt | Fabian Metz | Amin Oueslati

## Scope

In this project we develop a an animated visualization for an insertion sort algorithm using Matplotlib animation. The visulization displays the user the current state of the array after each sorting iteration, while keeping track of the number of iterations necessary to fully sort the array. 

## Use

To use the algorithm, simply input the size of the array that you wish to sort.
