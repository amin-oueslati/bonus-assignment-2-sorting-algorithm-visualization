Data Structures & Algorithms S-2023 | Hertie School | Extra Credit Assignment 2 - Sorting Algorithm Visualization

@authors: Oskar Krafft | Paul Sharratt | Fabian Metz | Amin Oueslati

## Scope

In this project we develop an animated visualization for an insertion sort algorithm using Matplotlib animation. The visualization displays to the user the current state of the array after each sorting iteration, while keeping track of the number of iterations.

## Use

To use the algorithm, simply input the size of the array that you wish to sort.
